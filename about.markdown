It was never a dream to work to write software when I was a kid. I did not even know what software was back then, I only knew of games my grand-father showed me on his Commodore. I can only recall that story because it was told to me. A few years later, it was my dad that played Timelapse and Star-Wars X-Wing vs Tie-Fighter that got me curious about those machines but I was still not hooked.

Interest renew many years later, in high school with my first programming class. That is about when I started tinkering with PCs, gathering pieces where I could and trying to upgrade a old PC we got for nothing but that was it. I really had no career plan at this point (who really has a career plan at 18 years old...) and I applied to a technical degree in computer science. I am lucky to have been selected because I really have no idea what I would be doing otherwise.

From there I met wonderful people with a deep passion for what would eventually become their craft, and mine. Their intensity and enthusiasm was contagious. It is still, to this day, what pushes me to get better. 

I worked in many sectors, from start-ups to mega-corps and in between up to the public sector. Always in some form or another related to cyber(security): 
- building EDRs
- pushing kernel research
- creating security primitives for MDRs and developers
- simulating adversarial behaviors, in different settings, for testing defenders capabilities and as a product

Software engineering found me; cyber(security) found me. What this means in the age of AI is still uncertain but it sure means we will iterate faster, whichever direction we take.

This place will talk about AI but I will not use it to feed you AI slop, that is a promise.
